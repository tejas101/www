      <value>&lt;p&gt;The chart below looks at the average age of the Parliament members over the last 15 Lok Sabhas. The average age has increased from 46.5 years from the first Lok Sabha to 53.03 years for the 15th Lok Sabha (2009-2014).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the 12th Lok Sabha (1998-99) witnessed the lowest average age of MPs at 46.4, a notch below the first Lok Sabha of 1952.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The 13th Lok Sabha was the oldest house where the average age of the MPs was 55.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The last i.e. the 15th Lok Sabha had an average age of 53.03 years and was the third oldest house. It remains to be seen what the state of the new Lok Sabha, which will be the 16th, would be as India is &lt;a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-is-set-to-become-the-youngest-country-by-2020/article4624347.ece\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;expected &lt;/a&gt;to become the world&amp;#8217;s youngest country with 64% of population in the working age group by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
