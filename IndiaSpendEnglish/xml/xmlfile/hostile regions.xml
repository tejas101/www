      <value>&lt;p&gt;India has come down a notch to 3rd on list of countries with high social hostilities involving religion in the world in 2012, just after Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to a recent report published by Pew Research. The report which looks at &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2014/01/14/religious-hostilities-reach-six-year-high/#interactive\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Religious Hostilities Reach Six Year High&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; says that countries with a high or very high level of social hostilities involving religion reached a six-year peak in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;While the sharpest increase was seen in the Middle East and North Africa, there was a significant increase in religious hostilities in the Asia-Pacific region, with China becoming the latest entrant.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
