      <value>&lt;p&gt;Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has put his foot down and shut the doors on foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail in the nation&amp;#8217;s capital.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader wrote to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on January 13, 2014, seeking to withdraw the Government&amp;#8217;s permission to allow FDI in multi-brand retail in the state. The previous Congress Government, led by Sheila Dixit, had given the green signal to FDI in retail.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Under the current policy, FDI in multi-brand retail is permitted only in states that allow such an investment. Only 12 states and union territories have given it the green signal so far. These include: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Daman &amp;amp; Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Rajasthan.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping FDI in multi-brand retail was part of the AAP election manifesto, and Kejriwal justified his decision saying: &amp;#8220;While FDI provides a wide range of choice to consumers, it has been seen in several countries that it has led to unemployment. There is a huge unemployment problem in Delhi. We don&amp;#8217;t want to increase it further.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma &lt;a href="http://www.ptinews.com/news/4315998_AAP-s-decision-on-FDI-in-retail-irresponsible--Sharma-.html"&gt;reacted&lt;/a&gt; the same day saying that the move was abrupt, irresponsible and ill-considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2012, during debates on FDI and its impact on the livelihood of small traders, the Commerce Ministry had cited a study conducted by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) titled the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://164.100.47.132/Annexture/lsq15/12/au1644.htm"&gt;Impact of Organised Retailing on the Unorganised Sector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The study which was done in 2008 highlights the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Adverse impact on sales and profit of unorganised retailers weakens over time&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence of a decline in overall employment in the unorganised sector as a result of the organised retailers&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Rate of closure on account of competition from organised retail is lower still at 1.7% per annum&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Farmers benefit significantly from the option of direct sales to organised retailers&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Profit realization for farmers selling directly to organised retailers is about 60% higher than that received from selling to the mandi (wholesale market).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;India&amp;#8217;s business community isn&amp;#8217;t happy with the decision either, saying that the move will most likely throw a wet blanket on foreign investments in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Industry body ASSOCHAM on January 14, 2014, said: &amp;#8220;If one party reverses the decision of its rival dispensation upon change of guards, the policy and political risks for global investors would definitely increase in India, scaring them away.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) reacted on social networking platform Twitter expressing its disappointment:&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;J Suresh, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) National Retail Committee told news agency Press Trust of India: &amp;#8220;It is unfortunate that the Delhi Government has chosen not to allow FDI in multi-brand retail in Delhi. This will discourage international retailers planning to enter India.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;CII&amp;#8217;s Twitter account posted a quote by Thomas Varghese, the former Chairman of the CII National Retail Committee saying that modern retail can generate 10 million jobs by 2020:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      <value>&lt;p&gt;While Kejriwal drew the curtains on FDI in multi-brand retail, he has said that he is not opposed to FDI. He says that it has to be decided on a sector-by-sector basis, and he will soon meet industrialists to discuss further changes.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
