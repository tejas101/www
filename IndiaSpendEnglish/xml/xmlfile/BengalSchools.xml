      <value>&lt;p&gt;While speaking at a rally in Kolkata recently, Bharatiya Janata Party&amp;#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi &lt;a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modis-message-to-mamata-banerjees-bengal-cholbe-na/1/341868.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that only 60% schools in West Bengal have toilets for girls while many schools are not even electrified. His question was: how would kids learn computers then?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The West Bengal Government was quick to respond to the charges, and the state&amp;#8217;s education &lt;a href="http://www.wbsed.gov.in/wbsed/default.html"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; put out a statement where they claimed that 82% schools had separate toilets for girls. The statement also mentioned that there are more than 6,446 schools in the state with more than four computers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;But Modi&amp;#8217;s statement and our Fact Check throws up a data point, which, if true, is far more worrying than his general point. Which is that less than 10% of 94,572 schools in West Bengal have computers. A number that is less than half the national average of 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at the key heads of Modi&amp;#8217;s claims i.e. percentage of schools with girls&amp;#8217; toilets and schools with electricity and computers. We also looked at functioning toilets in schools in the state with data from District Information System for Education (DISE), a central data collection set up of the Ministry of Education.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;So, Modi was off on the mark on schools with girls&amp;#8217; toilets but there were only 59% schools with functioning toilets &amp;#8211; very near the claim made by Modi. And only 35% of the schools have electricity and 9.6% have computers. Here, Modi seems to have got the numbers right.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen from the graphic above that Gujarat does better compared to West Bengal. For example, 97% schools in Gujarat have toilets for girls and all of 97% are actually functioning toilets. In fact, Gujarat is among the few states that have done better than the national average on various factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;West Bengal has one of the lowest percentage of schools with computers along with other states like Chhattisgarh (8.2%) and Jharkhand (8.2%).&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;The national average for schools with computers is 22% while it is 71% for Gujarat. Almost 90% schools in Kerala have computers, which is the highest in the country, followed by Gujarat. IndiaSpend had earlier reported on the state of school &lt;a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/sectors/the-long-road-to-basic-amenities-in-indias-schools"&gt;amenities&lt;/a&gt; across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal issued a &lt;a href="http://news.oneindia.in/kolkata/narendra-modi-gave-factually-incorrect-data-about-bengal-tmc-1390080-lse.html"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;after Modi&amp;#8217;s comments: &amp;#8220;The research team, which provided him with these figures, clearly depended on an old report. According to the report of a review committee, 98% schools in West Bengal have toilets while most primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools have uninterrupted power supply.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Bengal Government, however, did not refer to the number of schools with computers. Possibly there is a fair bit of truth in Modi&amp;#8217;s statement.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
