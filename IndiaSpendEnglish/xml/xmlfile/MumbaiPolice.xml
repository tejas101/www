      <value>Earlier this week, we told you which &lt;a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/viznomics/what-car-not-to-buy-according-to-mumbai-police-3"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; would be the worst ones to put your money on, according to &lt;a href="http://www.mumbaipolice.org/Annual%20Press%20Briefing%202011.pdf"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; released by the Mumbai Police. &amp;nbsp;This time, &lt;strong&gt;IndiaSpend&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="mailto:Danielle@indiaspend.org"&gt;Danielle Collaco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; looks at 2-wheelers that Mumbai&amp;#8217;s bike lifters took a shine to during 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Data released by the police department shows that Bajaj Pulsar is the most coveted two-wheeler among thieves followed by Hero Splendor and Honda Activa.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div style="width:625px;margin-top:15px"&gt;&lt;div id="InRead"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2,600 two-wheelers were stolen in Mumbai during 2011, which is about 100 more than the 2,500 two-wheelers stolen in the city during 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Around 510 Pulsars were stolen during 2011. However, this was a decline of almost 10% from 569 Pulsars stolen during 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Bike lifters had a field day with the Honda Unicorn&amp;#8230; 164 bikes were stolen in 2011, an increase of 49% over the previous year when 110 bikes were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Yamaha saw an increase of almost 45% as far as thefts were concerned in 2011 with 55 bikes being stolen while 38 were stolen in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;According to data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, two-wheeler sales saw an increase of &lt;a href="http://www.siamindia.com/scripts/domestic-sales-trend.aspx"&gt;14.16%&lt;/a&gt; at 13,435,769 units during 2011-12. &amp;nbsp;Bajaj Auto reported 15% increase in two-wheeler sales at 3.83 million units during 2011-12.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows the 5 bikes that were the most popular among bike lifters during 2011:&lt;/p&gt;</value>
