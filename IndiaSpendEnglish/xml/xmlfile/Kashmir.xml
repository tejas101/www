      <value>&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a turnout of &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/specials/2014-assembly-elections/jammu-kashmir-news/JK-assembly-polls-Voters-defy-separatists-election-boycott-call-71-28-turnout-in-first-phase/articleshow/45273423.cms"&gt;more than 71%&lt;/a&gt;. This is the highest over the past 18 years (assembly elections in J&amp;amp;K are held every six years).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The high participation of voters, despite the boycott calls by separatist groups and the recent floods, is being widely lauded, but an indication of J&amp;amp;K&amp;#8217;s troubled existence is available from its highest-ever voter turnout, which came 27 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In 1987, 75% of voters turned out to vote, but the election was widely seen as flawed, with even members of the Congress party alleging malpractices, such as this &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2223364.stm"&gt;recollection&lt;/a&gt; by Khem Lata Wukhloo:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I remember that there was a massive rigging (sic) in 1987 elections. The losing candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people&amp;#8217;s faith in the elections and the democratic process.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Many parties which lost in 1987 went on form a separatist alliance and the state eventually exploded into violent insurgency, the murder and exodus of Pandits, or Kashmiri Hindus, and a security crackdown that led to thousands of deaths, overwhelmingly Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Voter participation in elections plunged dramatically after this, recovering to some extent 21 years later, although trouble and dissatisfaction continued to roil the state.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick view of the voter turnout in the past assembly polls in the state:&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;An interesting fact: the first assembly election in J&amp;amp;K, in 1962, had &lt;a href="http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1962/StatRep_JK_1962.pdf"&gt;no women registered&lt;/a&gt; as voters. However, there was one woman who contested, &lt;a href="http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1962/StatRep_JK_1962.pdf"&gt;Shanta Bharti&lt;/a&gt;, but she lost her deposit. So, women were allowed to contest but not vote. The participation of women rose in subsequent elections.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
