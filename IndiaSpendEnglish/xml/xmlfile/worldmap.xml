      <value>&lt;p&gt;With the general elections round the corner, IndiaSpend decided to do a quick analysis of the seats held by women Parliamentarians across the world. African countries like Rwanda and Andorra have the highest women representation of 63.8% and 50%, respectively, followed closely by Cuba with 49% representation at the end of 2013, according to &lt;a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;released by World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;While the United States had 17% representation, U.K and China were at 23%, approximately.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;On the domestic front, there is good news as the number of women in India&amp;#8217;s Parliament has increased slowly over the years to 11% as compared to 8.3% in 2004.
