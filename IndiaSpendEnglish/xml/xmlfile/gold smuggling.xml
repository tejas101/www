      <value>&lt;p&gt;Addressing tax officials on the Customs Day on 28th Jan, Finance&amp;nbsp;Minister P Chidambaram said that there has been an &lt;a href=\"http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-3000-kg-of-gold-being-smuggled-into-country-every-month-finance-minister-378855\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; in the smuggling of gold to the tune of about 1-3 tonnes every month ever since the restrictions were imposed on the yellow metal last year. IndiaSpend did a quick check to see the amount of gold smuggled into the country, and yes, there has been a sharp jump over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the Lok Sabha &lt;a href=\"http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/QResult15.aspx?qref=148295\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that the number of gold smuggling cases jumped 449% &amp;nbsp;to 664 cases in 2013 (Data till Oct) from 121 cases in 2010. The increase in the value of the gold is obviously a lot more with the total value coming to around Rs 208 cr during Jan-Oct 2013 from 17.2 cr in 2010. &amp;nbsp;Most of the seized gold has been from countries like UAE, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;In fact, numerous media reports of gold smuggling have been highlighted with the &lt;a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/four-held-with-gold-worth-over-rs-1-50-cr-at-airport-114012800828_1.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; one being the arrest of four people who were &amp;nbsp;trying to smuggle gold bars into the country worth over Rs 1.5 cr.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Last year,&amp;nbsp;the government had increased customs duty on gold three times in order to contain the&amp;nbsp;Current Account Deficit (CAD). However, the statement made by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the CAD is expected to decline to below 2.5% of GDP from 1.8% a year ago have raised expectations of a cut in the import duty on gold.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
