      <value>There have been charges and counter-charges between the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-led NDA about the progress (or lack of it) of road projects during the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;While BJP claims that road building has come to a virtual stand-still under the UPA, the Congress is countering that more projects are being executed under their regime.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick fact check on only one aspect &amp;#8211; national highways &amp;#8211; of the 3.3 million kms road network in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;As the table below shows, the national highways network increased from 49,585 kms in 1999 to 65,569 kms in 2004 &amp;#8211; an increase of 15,984 kms during the NDA regime which lasted five years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;And the NH network&amp;nbsp; under the UPA increased from 65,569 kms to 79,243 kms as of today &amp;#8211; an increase of 13,674 kms from 2004, which is nine years.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;* Per day increase is calculated using = (New year road built &amp;#8211; Previous year Road Built / no.of working days in a Year)(Source: &lt;a href="http://www.nhai.org/roadnetwork.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;NHAI&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://morth.nic.in/showfile.asp?lid=839" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ministry of Road Transport &amp;amp; Highways&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;# refers to the fact that the road built might not have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
