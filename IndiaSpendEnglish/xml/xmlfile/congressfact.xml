      <value>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14220\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.indiaspend.com/wp-content/uploads/MODI-WIDTH-300px_HT.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\"&gt;Here is a &lt;b&gt;Fact Check&lt;/b&gt; on a &lt;b&gt;Fact Check&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;a href=\"http://www.inc.in/Factcheck\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; on the claims made by Narendra Modi, Gujarat Chief Minister and the Prime Ministerial candidate of Bharatiya Janata Party&amp;nbsp; (BJP) ahead of the six-phased General Elections scheduled from April 7, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#Claim 1: Employment Generation in Gujarat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The first claim that the Congress has fact checked is Modi&amp;#8217;s claim on employment. According to Modi&amp;#8217;s claim, employment exchanges generated 78% of the jobs in Gujarat. But the Fact Check by the Congress says the Ahmedabad employment exchange generated only 0.7% jobs till April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at the same site, &lt;a href=\"http://www.talimrojgar.org/Scripts/ListofExchangeEx.asp\"&gt;Commissionerate of Employment&amp;amp; Training in Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, and found that 256,951 applicants were provided placements as against a total 1,055,919 job-seekers between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; April 2013 and 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; February 2014. Therefore, the total number of jobs provided by employment exchanges was 24%. This is for the state. For the city of Ahmedabad, in case the Congress Fact Check was referring to that, the figure is 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#Claim 2: Spending On Education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The next claim that Congress looked into was Modi&amp;#8217;s claim that China spent 20% of its GDP on education and urging that India should emulate this spending. The Congress Fact Check claims that China actually spends only 3.9% of its GDP on education while India spends 4% of its GDP on education.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to look at the education sector spend of BRICS countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the table, Modi&amp;#8217;s claim of China spending 20% of GDP on education is inaccurate. But the Congress claim of India spending 4% of GDP on education is a little off too. At the end of 2010, India was spending 3.9% of GDP on education. However, it has seen a decline from 3.9% to 3.2% of GDP at the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;China, on the other hand, is now spending 4% of GDP on education. The highest spender among BRICs at the end of 2010 was South Africa, which was spending over 10% of its GDP on education.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Claim 3: Poor Learning Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
Congress claims that children in Gujarat are way below the national average in mathematics. So, we looked at the latest &lt;a href=\"http://img.asercentre.org/docs/Publications/ASER Reports/ASER_2013/4-pagers/enrollmentandlearning_english.pdf\"&gt;ASER report&lt;/a&gt;, which is an effort by an NGO Pratham that analyses learning outcomes across schools in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;So, the Fact Check by Congress here does seem to be true. Students in Gujarat are lower than the national average in both subtraction and division.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The graph above shows the top 5 states based on the population &amp;#8211; Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Gujarat scores less compared to states like Bihar and West Bengal, according to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.asercentre.org/Keywords/p/205.html\"&gt;ASER 2013 report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The Gujarat Government, it appears, has initiated steps to improve outcomes and education is now a focus area for the state. As per the 2013-14 Budget estimates, the Government &lt;a href=\"http://financedepartment.gujarat.gov.in/budget13_14_pdf/Highlight_of_the_Budget_English.pdf\"&gt;has increased plan&lt;/a&gt; spending on education to Rs 3,850 crore during the current year (2013-14) from 2,700 crore in 2012-13.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;strong&gt;#Claim 4: Achievements In Sports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi has been very critical of the Congress Government at the centre on its approach to sports and India&amp;#8217;s progress in sporting activities, especially at the Olympics. The Congress Fact Check claims that Gujarat&amp;#8217;s performance in the 34thNational Games held in 2011 medals and a rank of 28th. States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had higher medal tally of 12 and 70, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The Fact Check also claimed that while Gujarat won no gold medals, UP won 20 gold medals. And this Fact Check, again, is true&amp;#8230; Gujarat, however, has increased its spending on sports from Rs 249 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 300.5 crore in &lt;a href=\"http://financedepartment.gujarat.gov.in/budget13_14_pdf/Budget_at_a_Glance_English.pdf\"&gt;2013-14&lt;/a&gt;, was increase of 20%.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
