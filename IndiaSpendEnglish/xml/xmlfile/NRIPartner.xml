      <value>Marriages may be made in heaven, but for a lot of Indians looking for the ideal NRI (non-resident Indian) partner, their weddings turn out to be a farce. We get to read about a lot of &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Fraudulent-NRI-marriages-on-the-rise/articleshow/27667834.cms"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; in which people have married NRIs but were later cheated or abandoned abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Recent data released by the central government shows the number of complaints/cases received about fraudulent marriages in Indian diplomatic missions abroad:&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;Since 2011-12, there have been a total of 188 cases/complaints of fraudulent marriages in Indian diplomatic missions. Most of these cases have been in the USA, 139. The numbers have declined in 2013-14 from 49 to 39 compared to the previous year. There was a rise in such frauds from 26 in 2011-12 to 49 in 2012-13 for the USA.  The next most unreliable destination for NRI marriages is Canada (22), followed by the United Kingdom (13).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;General (Retd.) V. K. Singh (Minister of State in the ministries of Overseas Indian Affairs &amp;amp; External Affairs) during a reply in Lok Sabha &lt;a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=112983"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Indian Missions provide financial assistance for legal procedures and counselling.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs provides legal and financial assistance to Indian women deserted by their Indian or foreign husbands overseas. The amount of &lt;a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=112983"&gt;assistance&lt;/a&gt; given is up to $3,000 in developed countries and $2,000 in developing countries. Such financial help is provided through missions or posts in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Gulf countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
