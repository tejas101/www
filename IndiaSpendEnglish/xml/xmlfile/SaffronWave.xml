      <value>&lt;p&gt;The shock-and-awe of the Narendra Modi blitzkreig worked the best in Uttar Pradesh where the party won 71 seats out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats. A feat never achieved by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its three-decade history. The wave decimated the Bahjuan Samaj Party (BSP), which could not win even a single seat in the state. While Samajwadi Party (SP) could win five seats (only Mulayam Singh Yadav and his family members won) Congress could win only two seats (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Maharashtra, which sends 48 MPs to the Lok Sabha, also saw a safforn sweep. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won 41 seats. While Congress could win only two seats, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) won four seats.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div style="width:625px;margin-top:15px"&gt;&lt;div id="InRead"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BJP did a clean sweep in Gujarat by winning all the 26 seats. It also had a clean sweep in four other states: Rajasthan where the party won all the 25 seats followed by Delhi by winning all the seven seats, Uttarakhand by winning all the five seats and Himachal Pradesh where it won all the four seats.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The party had a near-clean sweep in Madhya Pradesh by winning 27 out of the total 29 seats. BJP did extremely well in Bihar by winning 22 out of the total 40 seats. The party also put up a solid show in Chhattisgarh (10/11), Jharkhand (12/14), Karnataka (17/28), Haryana (7/10) and Assam (7/14).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;BJP&amp;#8217;s ally Telugu Desam Party (TDP) did well in Andhra Pradesh by winning 16 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;West Bengal, which sends 42 MPs to the Lok Sabha, saw Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress steal the show with 34 seats. While Congress won four seats, BJP could win only two seats here.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Tamil Nadu was a near-clean sweep for Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK, which won 37 out of the 39 Lok Seats. Naveen Patnaik-led BJD won 20 out of the 21 seats in Odisha.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance ended with a tally of 377 seats, a feat not seen since the 1984 Lok Sabha elections.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
