      <value>&lt;p&gt;Indian voters have surely come a long way, and this is visible in the sharp increase in the number of registered voters. From 173 million registered voters in the first general election&lt;br&gt;&#13;
in 1951-52, the number this time has shot up to 814 million voters, which is more than the electorates of the United States and Europe combined.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the per cent increase in total electors since the first general elections as well as gender-wise break-up. However, it must be noted that male/female data is available only from 1971 on wards.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
