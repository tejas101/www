      <value>The next time you consider upgrading your set of wheels, you might want to keep this in mind, especially if you live in Mumbai. &lt;a href="http://www.mumbaipolice.org/Annual%20Press%20Briefing%202011.pdf"&gt;Data released&lt;/a&gt; by the Mumbai police shows that during 2011, carjackers took quite a fancy to sports utility vehicles (SUVs) with the Mahindra Scorpio being the most coveted followed by the Mahindra Bolero and the Chevrolet Tavera.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;About 1,540 four-wheelers were stolen in Mumbai in 2011, which is about 32.75 per cent more than 1,160 four-wheelers stolen in 2010. Of the 1,540 vehicles stolen during 2011, the Mahindra Scorpio was stolen the most with 133 vehicles. This is, however, a decline of about 10 per cent from 148 Scorpios stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div style="width:625px;margin-top:15px"&gt;&lt;div id="InRead"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another car that seemed to be quite in demand was the Chevrolet Tavera. About 67 cars were stolen in 2010 but there was a 58 per cent increase in 2011 where 106 cars were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;About 106 Mahindra Boleros were stolen during 2011, up 34 per cent from the 79 Boleros stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Hyundai Santro was also quite popular among the car thieves in Mumbai. While 83 cars were stolen in 2010, the year 2011 saw an increase of almost 28 per cent where 106 cars were stolen in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Toyota Qualis isn&amp;#8217;t as popular as it used to be with only 52 cars being stolen in 2011 while 59 were stolen in 2010, a decline of almost 12 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Honda City saw an increase of a little over 23 per cent with 37 cars being stolen in 2011 as opposed to 30 that were stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Tata Indica saw an increase of almost 10 per cent with 67 cars being stolen in 2011 as opposed to 61 stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Maruti 800 witnessed an increase of almost 9 per cent with 62 cars being stolen in 2011 and 57 being stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Maruti Esteem witnessed a decline of 6 percent with 58 cars being stolen in 2011 while 62 were stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Cab drivers in the city can breathe a sigh of relief. There was a 10 per cent decline in thefts in 2011 with 61 cars reported stolen as opposed to 68 that were reportedly stolen in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the &lt;a href="http://www.siamindia.com/scripts/domestic-sales-trend.aspx"&gt;growth rate&lt;/a&gt; for passenger vehicles in&amp;nbsp;2011-12 was nearly 5% at 2,618,072 units. Interestingly, while Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra sold&amp;nbsp;about 50,844 Scorpios in 2011-12, which is an increase of 17%, the company sold over 100,686 Boleros in the same period, an increase of 21%.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Motors sold 8% more Indicas in 2011-12 at 105,706 units.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The graph shows the top five models of cars that have been popular with the carjackers in Mumbai in 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
