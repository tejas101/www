      <value>&lt;p&gt;There have been reports, off late, from villages in Northern India about a man-eating tiger that has claimed its 10th victim. The killer cat has been identified as having an orange hide with dark stripes, white underbelly, long tail, huge paws and fearsome teeth, and is commonly know as the Royal Bengal tiger.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Such &lt;a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/26/world/asia/india-rogue-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;attacks &lt;/a&gt;have been taking place over a course of time, and hence we decided to look at the data on the number of people killed by animals in the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The infographic below highlights some of these points. A small note here &amp;#8211; the numbers are not indicative of deaths due to tigers but of all deaths caused by animals or as described by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
