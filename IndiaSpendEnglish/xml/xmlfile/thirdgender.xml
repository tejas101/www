      <value>&lt;p&gt;The recent decision by Supreme Court to recognise transgender as the third category of gender is seen as step in the right direction for the transgender population in India.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Transgenders are also citizens of India&amp;#8221; said Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and A.K. Sikri in their ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;They also added that if transgenders were not recognised as a third gender, it would violate their rights to equality, job opportunity, life and personal liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;IndiaSpend decided to look at the data given by the Election Commission as per the &amp;#8216;other&amp;#8217; category and here is what we found.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;* The third gender represents only 0.0035% or 28,341 electors of the total electors of 814 million (approx).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;* Karnataka had the highest no of &amp;#8216;other&amp;#8217; voters at 8,453 followed by Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;* Among the electors aged between 18-19 years, 0.018% or 4,177 electors belonged to the &amp;#8216;other&amp;#8217; category. Here too, Karnataka had the highest number with 2,589 people.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
