      <value>&lt;p&gt;World Bank puts out around 300 reports but their own analysis has shown that around 100 of these reports are not read at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;World Bank provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries across the world. In doing so, the Bank produces a wealth of information, papers and documents aimed at helping reach policy solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div style="width:625px;margin-top:15px"&gt;&lt;div id="InRead"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a World Bank Paper titled &amp;#8216;Which World Bank Reports Are Widely Read?&amp;#8221; almost 31% policy reports were never downloaded. Between 2008-2012, there were 1611 documents published out of which 517 were never downloaded even once. And even when they were used, 87% policy reports were not cited. Nearly 49% of World Bank&amp;#8217;s reports have the stated objective of informing the public or influencing the development community.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;According to their analysis, the reports that are downloaded the most are the ones with emerging countries as a focus of study. Their most downloaded report is &amp;#8220;Vietnam Development Report 2009: Capital Matters&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
