      <value>&lt;p&gt;The Government has detected over Rs 1 lakh crore ($16 billion) worth of undisclosed income by various tax payers across the country after conducting search-and-seizure operations and surveys in the last financial year (2013-14).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The data shows that there has been a huge jump in undisclosed income to over Rs 90,390 crore in the last financial year. There does not seem to be a clear explanation for this sharp rise.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;According to an &lt;a href=\"http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/psearch/QResult16.aspx?qref=1657\"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; given by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to a question in Lok Sabha recently, while the number of surveys conducted by the tax department has increased in the last three years, search-and-seizure operations have declined.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;There has been a decline of over Rs 5,000 crore in undisclosed income during search-and-seizure operations in the last three years i.e. from over Rs 15,000 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 10,000 crore in 2013-14.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The department has also been increasing the scrutiny assessments of returns with each year.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;And here is another data point: nearly Rs 1,80,000 crore is locked up in appeals at various forums like Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), High Courts and the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;These data also point to the broad observation made by the Finance Minister during the Budget speech that &lt;a href=\"http://www.indiaspend.com/fact-check/budget-2014-fact-check-rs-4-lakh-crore-tax-claims-stuck-42485\"&gt;over Rs 4 lakh crore tax claims&lt;/a&gt; are stuck in litigations.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
