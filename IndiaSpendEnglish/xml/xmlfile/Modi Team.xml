      <value>&lt;p&gt;Even after Prime Minister Narendra Modi &lt;a href=\"http://pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/portfolios-of-the-union-council-of-ministers-2/\"&gt;expanded his team to 66 ministers&lt;/a&gt;, it is leaner than the council of ministers headed by former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of Singh&amp;#8217;s UPA-II ministry stood at 78 after its final reshuffle in October 2012. The Vajpayee government started in 1998 with a 56-member ministry but was expanded to nearly 88 ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Modi ministry now has 27 members of cabinet rank including the Prime Minister, 13 ministers of state with independent charge and 26 ministers of state.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

      <value>&lt;p&gt;There are some common names in the 2004 and 2014 BJP-led Goverments: Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitely, Sushma Swaraj, Suresh Prabhu, Ram Vilas Paswan, Maneka Gandhi, Uma Bharti, Bandaru Dattatreya, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Rajiv Pratap Rudy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;But the key name that could make all the difference over the next five years &amp;#8211; Prime Minister Narendra Modi &amp;#8211; was nowhere near the council of ministers between 1999 and 2004.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
