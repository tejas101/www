&lt;p&gt;Syria continues to remain the bloodiest country for journalists for the second year running, according to a report published by the International News Safety Institute. A total of 134 journalist and media staff were killed on reporting assignments last year in over 29 countries and most of them were targeted deliberately. While Syria and Pakistan continued to retain their place among the world&amp;#8217;s five most dangerous countries for journalist, Iraq, Philippines and India were also in the top five of the list.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
