      <value>&lt;p&gt;The world observed December 3 as the International Day of People with Disability. Around 15% of the world&amp;#8217;s population, estimated around 1 billion, are living with disability.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Census 2011 did not release data on the disabled population in India. The disability population is difficult to enumerate in India since people often hide their disabilities because of social stigma. According to the Ministry of Social Justice, as of 2001, 21 million people are said to be suffering from some form of disability in India. Incidentally, the total population between Census 2001 and 2011 increased by 180 million to 1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
